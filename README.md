# CPOE
Stochastic Gradient Boosting to find Completion Percentage Over Expectation. NFL Analytics.

In this project, I am attempting to predict the probabilty of a pass being completed. I will be using a classifying algorithm called Gradient Boosting for this purpose. Hoewver, even tho increasing accuracy of prediction is what I wan't for the mdoel to work properly, I am more interested in the estimated probabilities rather than the predicted outcome. Why? Because we will eb estimating the error in prediction (Outcome - Prob of completion) to estimate by how much a passer over or under predicted in a given pass. Finally, I will be estimating the mean residual (which we call CPOE) for each QB during the 2019.
